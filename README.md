# Stroke Prediction

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting the likelihood of stroke in individuals based on various health indicators and demographic information. It leverages a dataset containing health records and employs machine learning techniques to assess stroke risk.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle's "healthcare-dataset-stroke-data.csv". It includes features such as age, hypertension status, heart disease status, marital status, work type, residence type, average glucose level, BMI, and smoking status.

## Prerequisites
Before running this project, ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
Required Python libraries:
pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
imblearn
xgboost
keras
seaborn
You can install these libraries using pip:

bash

## Setup
Clone the repository or download the project files to your local machine.
Ensure the dataset file healthcare-dataset-stroke-data.csv is placed in an accessible directory.
Open the Stroke_Prediction.ipynb notebook in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.

## Usage
Follow the instructions in the Stroke_Prediction.ipynb notebook, which are divided into sections:

Data Loading and Preprocessing: Loading the dataset and preparing it for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzing the data to understand the distribution of variables and relationships between them.
Model Building: Building and training machine learning models to predict stroke risk.
Model Evaluation: Evaluating the performance of the models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
